# Conways Game of life

[Conways game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) is a
[Cellular Automata](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
in which any living cells with 2 or 3 neighbors live,
any dead cell with 3 neighbors comes back to life,
and all other cells die.

I created this simulation using
[RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/).
